  Why it’s good for enterprise decision-making
The mix of behavioral (campaign interaction), demographic, and financial variables allows analysts to measure campaign performance, compute KPIs (conversion rate, average deposit value proxy via duration), and build a DSS to prioritize contacts. It supports descriptive analytics (conversion by job/education/month), visualizations (funnel, lift charts), and predictive models to optimize marketing spend and improve ROI.
  Suggested business question we can analyze
“Which customer attributes and campaign features best predict subscription to a term deposit, and how should marketing prioritize prospects to maximize conversions while minimizing cost?”
